For client-side validations, we first need jquery-validation and jquery-validation-unobtrusive library along with our general jquery and bootstrap library. In .NET Core, these should be added in wwwroot in the lib folder.


Then we need to add the reference to jquery.validate.min.js and jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js in our _ViewImports.cshtml so that they can be used throughout our application.


<script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="~/lib/jquery-validation/dist/jquery.validate.min.js"></script>
<script src="~/lib/jquery-validation-unobtrusive/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js"></script>
