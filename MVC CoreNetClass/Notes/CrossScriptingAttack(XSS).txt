Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that enables a cyberattacker to place client side scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages. When other users load affected pages, the cyberattacker's scripts run, enabling the cyberattacker to steal cookies and session tokens, change the contents of the web page through DOM manipulation, or redirect the browser to another page. XSS vulnerabilities generally occur when an application takes user input and outputs it to a page without validating, encoding or escaping it.
