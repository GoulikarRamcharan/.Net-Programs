Asynchronous actions in ASP.NET Core MVC allow you to handle long-running, I/O-bound operations without blocking the server's thread pool. This significantly improves the scalability and responsiveness of your application, especially under heavy load.

Key Concepts:

async and await keywords: These C# keywords are fundamental to asynchronous programming.
The async keyword marks a method as asynchronous, indicating that it can contain await expressions.

The await keyword pauses the execution of an async method until the awaited asynchronous operation completes, without blocking the calling thread.
