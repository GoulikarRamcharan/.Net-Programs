Filters in ASP.NET Core
-------------------------------
Filters in ASP.NET Core allow code to run before or after specific stages in the request processing pipeline.

Built-in filters handle tasks such as:

Authorization, preventing access to resources a user isn't authorized for.
Response caching, short-circuiting the request pipeline to return a cached response.


Each filter type is executed at a different stage in the filter pipeline:

Authorization filters:
-----------------------------
Run first.
Determine whether the user is authorized for the request.
Short-circuit the pipeline if the request is not authorized.

Resource filters:
------------------------
Run after authorization.
OnResourceExecuting runs code before the rest of the filter pipeline. For example, OnResourceExecuting runs code before model binding.
OnResourceExecuted runs code after the rest of the pipeline has completed.

Action filters:
---------------------
Run immediately before and after an action method is called.
Can change the arguments passed into an action.
Can change the result returned from the action.


Exception filters:
------------------------
Apply global policies to unhandled exceptions that occur before the response body has been written to.
Run after model binding and action filters, but before the action result is executed.
Run only if an unhandled exception occurs during action execution or action result execution.
