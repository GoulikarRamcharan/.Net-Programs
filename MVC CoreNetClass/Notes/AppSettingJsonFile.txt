What is the ASP.NET Core AppSettings.json File?(Old Web.Config File)
The appsettings.json file in an ASP.NET Core application is a JSON formatted file that stores configuration data. In this file, you can keep settings like connection strings, application settings, logging configuration, and anything else you want to change without recompiling your application. The settings in this file can be read at runtime and overridden by environment-specific files like appsettings.Development.json or appsettings.Production.json.

When we create an ASP.NET Core Web Application with an Empty or Razor Pages or MVC or Web API Project Template, Visual Studio automatically creates the appsettings.json file for us in the Properties Folder.

{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "MyCustomKey": "MyCustomKey Value coming from appsettings.json"
}
