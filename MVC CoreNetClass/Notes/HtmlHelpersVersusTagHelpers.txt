HTML Helpers:
HTML Helpers are methods provided by ASP.NET MVC that generate HTML markup using C# code directly within the Razor view files. They are essentially C# methods that return HTML strings and are used within Razor code blocks. HTML Helpers have been a part of ASP.NET MVC since its earlier versions.

Advantages of HTML Helpers:
------------------------------------------
Familiarity: Developers comfortable with C# coding can easily create dynamic HTML using HTML Helpers, as they involve standard C# coding practices.
Flexibility: HTML Helpers provide a high degree of control over the generated HTML since you’re working with C# directly. This can be advantageous when implementing complex logic within the view.
Fine-Grained Customization: You can customize the generated HTML in a very detailed manner by using HTML Helpers.
Disadvantages of HTML Helpers:
Readability: HTML Helpers can lead to less readable views, especially when the code is mixed with HTML markup and C# logic. This can make it harder for designers or front-end developers to understand the view’s structure.
Maintainability: The tight integration of C# code within the HTML markup can make views harder to maintain, as changes to the code can impact the overall structure of the view.

Tag Helpers:
-----------------
The Tag Helpers are a recent addition to ASP.NET Core MVC and provide a different approach to generating HTML markup. Tag Helpers allows developers to create custom HTML-like elements that encapsulate server-side logic, making the code more readable and separating concerns better.

Advantages of Tag Helpers:
-------------------------------------
Readability and Separation of Concerns: Tag Helpers improve the readability of views by resembling HTML markup and isolating server-side logic within custom tags. This promotes better separation of concerns between HTML structure and application logic.
Maintainability: Views written with Tag Helpers are generally more maintainable because the code is structured in a way that’s closer to standard HTML, making it easier for designers and front-end developers to collaborate.
Consistency: Tag Helpers allow you to create reusable components with consistent behavior across multiple views, reducing code duplication.
Tooling and IntelliSense: Tag Helpers provide better tooling support and IntelliSense in your IDE, helping developers write code faster and with fewer errors.
Disadvantages of Tag Helpers:
-------------------------------------
Learning Curve: Developers familiar with C# and HTML might need time to adapt to the Tag Helper syntax.
Limited Flexibility: Tag Helpers might not offer the same level of fine-grained customization as HTML Helpers, especially for more complex scenarios.
Extensibility
HTML Helpers: Creating custom HTML Helpers involves defining static methods that return HTML strings. This can be less intuitive and might require more effort to manage complex output or incorporate context-aware logic.
Tag Helpers: They are implemented as classes and provide a more structured and OOP-friendly way to extend functionality. This approach makes it easier to manage complex logic, maintain state, and integrate with other components.
 Performance
HTML Helpers and Tag Helpers: Performance differences between HTML Helpers and Tag Helpers are generally minimal and not the primary consideration for choosing one over the other. Both are efficient for generating HTML content, but Tag Helpers might offer slight performance improvements in certain scenarios due to their closer integration with the Razor view engine.
 Usage Scenarios
HTML Helpers: They are still useful for projects migrated from older versions of ASP.NET MVC or when working within a primarily C# Driven development approach.
Tag Helpers: Recommended for new projects due to their modern syntax, ease of use, and better integration with HTML. They are particularly beneficial in teams where front-end developers need to work closely with the views without deep C# knowledge.
